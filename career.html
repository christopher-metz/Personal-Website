        <h1>Career</h1>

        <p>I studied mathematics in undergrad, and after graduation I remodeled homes
          for a while. After breaking my arm and needing a different job I took a roll
          with a manufacturing company here in Seattle. I started doing database
          administration and analysis. I've been writing a lot of SQL and Python, and
          with just those two languages you can accomplish quite a lot. After some
          time doing that I realized that I really enjoy coding. Everything is just
          a puzzle to solve. I am excited to learn web development. I think the direction
          I would like to head is leaning towards the data engineering side. Hopefully
          I can get on with a great company that will allow me to learn how to build
          all the data pipelines, and then move to a smaller company where I can own
          a larger section. I would work on the front-end web development and the data pipelines. I hope this makes sense.</p>
